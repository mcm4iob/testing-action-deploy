## Usage

```yml
# ... rest of your workflow ...

jobs:
  deploy:
    needs: [check-and-lint, adapter-tests]

    # Trigger this step only when a commit on any branch is tagged with a version number
    if: |
      contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[skip ci]') == false &&
      github.event_name == 'push' &&
      startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Write permissions are required to create GitHub releases
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: write

    steps:
      - uses: ioBroker/testing-action-deploy@v1
        with:
          node-version: "22.x" # This should be LTS
          # build: 'true' # optional
          npm-token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }} # This must be created on https://www.npmjs.com in your profile under "Access Tokens". Omit this line if trusted publishing is activated.
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # This exists by default in GitHub Actions and does not need to be created.
          # If you want Sentry:
          sentry: true
          sentry-token: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
          sentry-project: "iobroker-my-adapter"
          sentry-version-prefix: "iobroker.my-adapter"
          # ... other options
```

## Usage of TRUSTED PUBLISHING

npm recommends to use trusted publishing. As npm tokens are no longer available for more than 90 days, trusted publishing is the only way to configure a permanent solution.
Please follow the official [guide to set up trusted publishing for github](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers#configuring-trusted-publishing).

After setting up the configuration at npmjs.com please ensure that your workflow has been adapted as following:
- the following permissions are set at workflow test-and.release.yml
  ```yml
  permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: write
  ```
  
- a npm-token is NOT provided
  ```yml
  - uses: ioBroker/testing-action-deploy@v1
    with:
      node-version: "22.x" # This should be LTS
      # build: 'true' # optional
      npm-token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }} # This must be created on https://www.npmjs.com in your profile under "Access Tokens". Omit this line if trusted publishing is activated.
      github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # This exists by default in Github Actions and does not need to be created.
  ```
